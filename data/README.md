# DB
Every file in [this directory](./openbaar lichaam/) contains an JSON data-object linked to a public body, like a manicipality. In the Netherlands exist about 400 manicipalities, 12 provinces, several waterboards and the house of representatives and senate. Each one of them have [elections](./verkiezingen/) and manicipalities take part in organising elections of larger public bodies.

The database also contains some information about [political parties](./politieke partijen/) and derivable [datalists](./_datalist_/).
